    {
        fn generic<T: ?Sized>(t: &T) {
            // --snip--
        }
        // A trait bound on ?Sized is the opposite of a trait bound on Sized:
        // we would read this as "T may or may not be Sized." This syntax is
        // only available for Sized, not any other traits.

        // Also note that we switched the type of the t parameter from T to &T.
        // Because the type might not be Sized, we need to use it behind some
        // kind of pointer. In this case, weâ€™ve chosen a reference.
